If there are external IPs that route to one or more cluster nodes, Kubernetes
Services can be exposed on those externalIPs. Traffic that ingresses into the
cluster with the external IP (as destination IP), on the Service port, will be
routed to one of the Service endpoints. externalIPs are not managed by Kubernetes
and are the responsibility of the cluster administrator.
